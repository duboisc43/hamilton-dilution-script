# 1:4 Sample Dilution Logic â€“ C++ Simulation

This project simulates a 1:4 dilution process across a 96-well plate, typically performed on a Hamilton Microlab STAR liquid handling robot. The logic was originally developed in HSL (Hamilton Scripting Language) and ported to C++ for demonstration and educational purposes.

## ðŸ’¡ Purpose

This simulation models a common pre-PCR multiplexing protocol:
- Add 75 ÂµL of diluent to each well of the destination plate
- Add 25 ÂµL of sample from the source plate
- Mix 3 times with 50 ÂµL
- One tip per well

It helps demonstrate how liquid handling automation logic can be expressed programmatically.

## ðŸ§ª Technologies

- **Language:** C++
- **IDE:** Visual Studio (or any C++ compiler)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `Dilution1to4C++.cpp` in your IDE.
3. Compile and run the program.
4. The output will simulate each step of the dilution protocol to the console.

## ðŸ“„ File

- `Dilution1to4C++.cpp` â€” C++ source file simulating a full 96-well pipetting procedure

---

## ðŸ§¬ Original Use Case

This logic was designed to support high-throughput sample preparation for next-generation sequencing (NGS) pipelines, where accurate dilutions are critical before PCR amplification steps.
